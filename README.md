# IT5007 Tutorial Setup and Submission

* Attach shell to the container on VSCode and work on your tutorial from /home/it5007/
```
cd /home/it5007/
```
* $```git clone <your github classroom repository url>```
* Once you are done with the changes to the code base, add node_modules to .gitignore, but ensure package.json reflects all packages you installed additionally.
* Make sure you commit your changes to the repository using the command:
  - $```git commit -am "answer to T3"```

## IT5007 Tutorial Submission
 * When pushing a change to remote repository, you will be asked for your github username and password. Recently, github has replaced passwords with personal access tokens. To generate a personal access token, follow the instructions in this link: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token.
 * ```$git push```
 * If you are coding in a branch use the following command instead: ```$git push -u origin <mybranchname>```
